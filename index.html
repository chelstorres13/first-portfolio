  <h2 class="orange-box"> About Me </h2>
  <p> Hi there! My name is Chelsea and I'm a current student at Thinkful. I'm a Software Developer based out of Kansas City, Missouri. </p>

  <h3> How I Arrived in Software Development </h3>
  <p> I have a diverse educational background but I was drawn to Software Development because: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> I love problem solving and working through complex problems. </li>
    <li> I enjoy collaborating with others on projects that require attention to detail. </li>
    <li> I'm driven by a life-long love of learning. </li>
      </ul>

  <h3> Other Interests </h3>
    <p> Most of my free time is spent with my family. We love doing anything outside. Our favorites include hiking, camping, and swimming. </p>
    <p> I love to read and I'm always looking for book recommendations. I'll read just about anything but I tend to choose non-fiction over fiction. </p>
    <p> Another area of study that I tend to be drawn to is philosophy - especially Eastern philosophy. I love to learn about how different cultures have perceived and interpreted reality throughout human history. </p>
